This is an app that my team started at HackUMass IV (2016).
My teammates were me (Caroline Kim), Kelly Min, and John O'Brien.
This app is designed for someone who is not familiar with the UMass campus. When you input your schedule in the app, it shows you how to get to your next class, how long it takes, and compares if it is faster by walking or by bus.

//This app is not done yet.
//We were able to put a map on the app with 4 specific buildings from UMass Amherst.
//It calculates the midpoint between starting point and destination and puts that point
//in the middle of the screen.
//It calculates the distance between two places to see how much the map should be 
//zoomed in when first initialized.
//It lets you select the building, starting time of class, and ending time of class.

//Still need to find a way to put all the classes in an array and print the schedule out.
//Need to incorporate more buildings and buildings from schedule onto map.
//Need to import bus schedule/bus tracker and compare time with walking time.
